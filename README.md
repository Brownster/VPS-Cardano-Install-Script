# VPS-Cardano-Install-Script

My notes on installing cardano node and relay whilst attempting to make script so next install is quicker.

notes are from all over but main two resources that got me started were https://cardano-foundation.gitbook.io and https://www.coincashew.com 

apt-get install git -y

git clone  https://github.com/Brownster/VPS-Cardano-Install-Script.git installsh

cd installsh

chmod 777 install_block_producer.sh

vi install_block_producer.sh.sh

You will then need to edit accordingly
